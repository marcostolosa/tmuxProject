# tmuxProject

A small shell script function called npt (new pentest in tmux) that allows to create tmux sessions with pre defined windows, panes and commands. Also, all panes are logged with the command script (which is called using a second function) so you can have register of everything you do in all terminals.  

The main idea here is to use this when you are working in a large project that demands a lot of terminals and you have to keep them organized so you don't lose track of your work and so you can log everything that's done.
